Implemented a new update procedure:
Updates will no longer be incorporated directly into the main.py file.

Instead, they will be stored in the LOG.txt file.
Each update, including this one, will have its own branch.




[======= NEW FEATURES AND BUG FIXES =======]
+ Cleaned up code a little bit. I discovered that I can use the '.strip()'
command instead of having to use '.lstrip().rstrip()'


+ Resolved an issue where a div couldn't be properly closed using the
SYNTAX.CLOSE command with a self-closing tag.


+ Corrected a spelling mistake in the error display.


+ Added new Tags:
textarea, object, iframe, map, abbr, acronym, address, article, form


+ Fixed new lines.
You can now use new lines in your code.
h1 | Hello /n World!


+ Added better commenting.
I fixed a bug where I broke script comments.
I changed the HTML comments to ( -- ),
& SiHTML comments are now set to ( // ).





[======= SUBJECT TO CHANGE / RECLASSIFICATION OF ERRORS =======]
! All @commands and tags require the syntax separator to take values.
This will be changed in the next couple of versions.
@set | SYNTAX.CLASS ..

This now longer seen as an error or a bug, this is now intentional.
and this entry will be removed in the next update.





[======= KNOWN BUGS AND ERRORS =======]
x Lists (ol & ul) are currently unable to receive tag attributes.
This is considered a low-priority fix.


x Enabled the use of variables in lists; however, they cannot include
text simultaneously at this time.
This is categorized as a high-priority fix.


x I have added some code that does nothing as of yet, this
will get proper functionality in the next update.
(This is related to variables in lists).




[======= SIDE NOTES / PLANS =======]
? This entire project is subject to a full rewrite.
This project is over 500+ lines long and doesn't have proper
code documentation.

? I want to change how variables work.
Nothing super major.


? I want add multiline comments.
This is a low priority.


? I want to add ALL HTML tags.
This is high priority.


? I want to clean and refactor code where it is needed.
Including better commenting.
This is high priority.


? I want to create a user manual for the language.
This is high priority.
